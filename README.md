# Hamid's CV Text CLI

A simple command-line tool that displays information about my work experience, skills, and projects.

## Installation

To use the CLI tool with `npx`, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npx hamid@latest
```

This will run the latest version of the CLI tool without having to install it globally on your system. The `npx` command allows you to execute a package without installing it, making it a convenient way to use the CLI tool without having to worry about version compatibility or conflicting dependencies.

## Usage

Once you have run the `npx hamid@latest` command, the CLI tool will display information about my experience, skills, and projects in the terminal. The information is organized into sections and displayed with borders for easy reading.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have any questions about the CLI tool, feel free to open an issue in the repository or contact me directly at `hamidfarmani1@gmail.com`.
